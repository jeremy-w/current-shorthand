### General Principles
Consonants are expressed by full-sized characters, such as
![]({{ S }}/s.jpg)&nbsp;**s,**
![]({{ S }}/t.jpg)&nbsp;**t,**
vowels by small characters, as in
![]({{ S }}/sit.jpg)&nbsp;**sit.**
**i** is a 'high-mid' vowel.
Some vowels are written at the 'low-mid' level, such as **o**,
as in
![]({{ S }}/not.jpg)&nbsp;**not.**

The only consonant that is written small is **L,**
expressed by low-mid ![]({{ S }}/L_lo.jpg) before vowels,
by high-mid ![]({{ S }}/L_hi.jpg) after vowels,
as in
![]({{ S }}/lot.jpg)&nbsp;**lot,**
![]({{ S }}/salt.jpg)&nbsp;**salt.**

The other consonants are distinguished by their 'projection'.
'Short' consonants, such as
![t]({{ S }}/t.jpg),
![s]({{ S }}/s.jpg),
![n]({{ S }}/n.jpg),
do not project at all.
The 'long' consonants are either
'high,' such as
![]({{ S }}/b.jpg)&nbsp;**b,**
'low,' such as
![]({{ S }}/c.t.jpg){: .tall }&nbsp;**c,**
or tall, such as
![]({{ S }}/tt.t.jpg){: .tall }&nbsp;**tt.**
Examples:
![]({{ S }}/bin.jpg)&nbsp;**bin,**
{% assign words = 'cat cab bitten' | split: ' ' %}{% for word in words -%}
    <img src="{{ S }}/{{ word }}.t.jpg" />{: .tall }&nbsp;**{{ word }}**{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}
{%- endfor -%}.

If the vowel before or after a consonant is not
<!-- BEGIN p 3 -->
written, the stroke is used to show the presence of a vowel — generally **e** — as in
![]({{ S }}/else.jpg)&nbsp;**else.**

When two consonants come together without any vowel between,
forming a 'consonant-group,'
they are, if possible, joined together without any stroke, as in
!["else"]({{ S }}/else.jpg),
where **ls** forms a 'ligature.'

If this cannot be done,
they are crowded together,
or written detached and close together,
as in
![crowded tn]({{ S }}/Etna_crowded.jpg),
![detached tn]({{ S }}/Etna_detached.jpg)
**Etna,**
or else 'grafted' together,
as in
![grafted md]({{ S }}/Camden.t.jpg){: .tall } **Camden.**

But many consonant-groups are expressed by simple characters,
such as
![]({{ S }}/th.jpg)&nbsp;**th**
in
![]({{ S }}/thin.jpg)&nbsp;**thin.**
Such groups as **st, ts,** are expressed by joining the loop of the **s** directly on to the **t**, as in
![]({{ S }}/state.jpg)&nbsp;**state**
![]({{ S }}/lets.jpg)&nbsp;**lets.**

A consonant-character standing alone is used as a 'sign,'
that is, a contraction of some special word,
or of several words pronounced alike.
Thus
![t]({{ S }}/t.jpg) = **to, too, two,**
![th]({{ S }}/th.jpg) = **the,**
which is however generally joined on to the following word, as in
![]({{ S }}/the-cat.t.jpg){: .tall } **the&nbsp;cat.**

Some signs are made by writing 'in position',
that is, raised or lowered above or below the line of writing.
Thus raised
![t]({{ S }}/t_hi.jpg) = **it,**
lowered
![n]({{ S }}/n_lo.t.jpg){: .tall } = **than.**
