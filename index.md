## Welcome to the ✨Current Corner✨

If you were looking for Henry Sweet's _Manual of Current Shorthand_ from 1892, you've found it!
It is the (Henry) Sweetest shorthand ever.
It is truly and entirely lineal, and it looks really darn fancy written with a broad edge pen.

### The Manual
- [**The Preface**]({{ "/manual/preface" | relative_url }}) positions Current against Pitman and Gabelsberger/Stolze, enumerates the advantages of Current, and recaps the development of the system. It ends with a downer: everyone Sweet was excited to show the finished, printed version of the shorthand he'd been working on for a decade had died before he got to that point. E-hugs from the future, Señor Sweet. Publishing paid off!
